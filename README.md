# KYC Identity Verification PoV Using Firework AI

## Overview

This Proof of Value (PoV) project showcases an end-to-end Identity Verification system designed for the **Know Your Customer (KYC)** process within Financial Services Institutions (FSI). Leveraging **Firework AI’s** platform and APIs, the solution efficiently handles document upload, classification, data extraction, validation, and reporting.

## Design Choices and Tradeoffs

### 1. **Technology Stack Selection**

- **Python (FastAPI)**: Chosen for its simplicity, rapid development capabilities, and seamless integration with machine learning libraries. FastAPI offers high performance and is well-suited for building APIs.
  
- **Firework AI Platform**: Selected for its robust document classification and OCR capabilities, reducing the need to develop and maintain custom ML models.

- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable and scalable relational database choice, ensuring data integrity and ease of use.

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Facilitates containerization, ensuring consistent environments across development and production. Docker Compose simplifies multi-container orchestration.

- **React.js (Optional)**: Provides a responsive and interactive frontend interface. For PoV purposes, it's optional but enhances user interaction.

### 2. **Backend Architecture**

- **Modular Design**: The backend is divided into distinct modules (`classifier.py`, `extractor.py`, `validator.py`, `reporting.py`) promoting maintainability and scalability.

- **API-First Approach**: Designing the system around APIs ensures flexibility, allowing easy integration with various frontend interfaces or third-party services.

### 3. **Integration with Firework AI**

- **Benefits**:
  - **Reduced Development Time**: Utilizing Firework AI’s APIs accelerates the PoV development by leveraging pre-built, optimized services.
  - **Scalability and Reliability**: Firework AI’s infrastructure ensures scalability and high availability.
  
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - **Dependency on Third-Party Service**: Relying on Firework AI introduces external dependencies, which may affect system availability if the service experiences downtime.
  - **Cost Considerations**: Depending on usage, integrating third-party APIs may incur additional costs compared to in-house solutions.

### 4. **Data Validation**

- **Simple Validation Rules**: Implemented basic validation for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, more comprehensive validation (e.g., cross-referencing with databases) would be necessary.
  
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - **Simplicity vs. Robustness**: While simple rules are easy to implement and understand, they may not capture all edge cases, potentially leading to false validations.

### 5. **Security Considerations**

- **Data Protection**: Uploaded documents are stored in a designated `uploads/` directory. In a real-world scenario, implementing encryption, access controls, and secure storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3 with appropriate permissions) would be essential.
  
- **API Security**: Currently, API endpoints lack authentication and authorization mechanisms. For enhanced security, integrating API keys, OAuth, or JWT-based authentication is recommended.

### 6. **Error Handling**

- **Basic Error Responses**: The system provides simple error messages. Enhancing error handling to cover a wider range of exceptions and providing more descriptive messages would improve user experience and debuggability.

### 7. **Scalability**

- **Containerization with Docker**: Enables horizontal scaling by adding more container instances as demand increases.
  
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - **Complexity**: Managing multiple containers and ensuring seamless communication between them can introduce operational complexity.

### 8. **Frontend Integration**

- **Optional React.js Frontend**: Offers a visual interface for interacting with the backend APIs, enhancing usability.
  
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - **Development Overhead**: Building and maintaining a frontend adds to the development effort, which might be unnecessary for a basic PoV focused on backend capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

To start the frontend application, navigate to the `src/frontend` directory and run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the React development server and open the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

To start the backend server, navigate to the `src/backend` directory and run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the FastAPI server and make it accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Data Storage & Scalability

The current implementation stores processed JSON data and uploaded images in local directories (`processed_data/` and `uploads/` respectively). For production environments, consider:

- Migrating to cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3) for better durability and access control
- Implementing horizontal scaling with load balancing (e.g., Kubernetes)
- Adding caching layers (Redis/Memcached) for frequently accessed data
- Using message queues (RabbitMQ/SQS) for async processing of intensive tasks
- Choosing horizontally scalable databases (Aurora/MongoDB Atlas)

## Model & System Improvements

### OCR Enhancement
- Fine-tune models specifically for identity documents
- Improve image preprocessing (noise reduction, contrast enhancement)
- Implement data augmentation and transfer learning techniques

### System Upgrades
1. Strengthen data validation with external database cross-referencing
2. Add robust security measures (encryption, auth protocols)
3. Expand error handling capabilities
4. Optimize API performance
5. Integrate logging and monitoring
6. Implement comprehensive testing suite

## Conclusion

This PoV demonstrates a viable Identity Verification system using Firework AI's platform for KYC processes. While the foundation is established with document classification and OCR capabilities, production deployment would require implementing the above improvements for security, scalability, and reliability.
